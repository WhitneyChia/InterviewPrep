https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/

Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle
containing only 1's and return its area.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [["1"]]
Output: 1
