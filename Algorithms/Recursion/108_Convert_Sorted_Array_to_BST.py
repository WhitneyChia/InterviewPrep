Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced
binary search tree.
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs
by more than one.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,3] and [3,1] are both a height-balanced BSTs.
